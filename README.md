## High Level Description:
BAVART is an Art Action Website that will hold a database of art pieces that are available for purchase from a variety of artists.  
After the user signs in, they can search for their favorite artist and bid on different items.  
When the time runs out on the item whoever the higher bidder is will be the new owner of the art piece.
